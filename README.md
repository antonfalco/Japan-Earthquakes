# Japan-Earthquakes
I created a GeoPandas Python script that allows for the visualization of recent strong earthquakes in the year 2023. I enclosed all earthquakes from January through August with a rating above Magnitude 4. 

I will enclose the excel files I have for Japan cities, saved earthquake magnitudes and locations, volcano locations and the Natural Earth background.
Other than needing to change the locations on your computer to locate the files, the rest of the script should run fine. 

You will need to style the map using some shapefiles. Due to size limitations, I cannot upload them on here, but I will point you to the link I used to access the data:
https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/

I used the 10m admin0, coastline, water, water areas, & roads shapefiles. For the background, I used the Natural Earth 2 raster file, found here:
